## Phase-by-Phase Handoff Protocol

### 🚀 Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1-2)
**Completion Criteria**: Both developers can run basic tests

#### Developer A Deliverables:
```python
# Must implement these interfaces for Developer B
class ContentState(BaseModel):
    workflow_id: str
    status: WorkflowStatus
    # ... complete state schema

class BaseAgent(ABC):
    async def execute(self, state: ContentState) -> ContentState:
        # Base agent functionality

# Error handling that Developer B will use
class AgentException(Exception):
    pass
```

#### Developer B Deliverables:
```python
# Must implement these interfaces for Developer A
class LLMService:
    async def generate_text(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        # Gemini API integration
    
    async def analyze_image(self, image_data: Any) -> str:
        # Multimodal analysis

class DatabaseService:
    async def save_state(self, state: ContentState) -> bool:
        # State persistence
```

#### Integration Test:
```python
# Both developers must pass this test at end of Phase 1
async def test_basic_integration():
    # Create state
    state = ContentState(workflow_id="test", status=WorkflowStatus.INITIATED)
    
    # Save to database (Developer B component)
    saved = await database_service.save_state(state)
    assert saved == True
    
    # Load from database (Developer B component) 
    loaded_state = await database_service.load_state("test")
    assert loaded_state.workflow_id == "test"
```

### 🔧 Phase 2: Core Agents (Week 3-5)
**Completion Criteria**: End-to-end content generation workflow

#### Developer A → Developer B Interface:
```python
# Developer A provides these interfaces
class ContentPlanner:
    async def plan_content(self, analysis: InputAnalysis) -> List[ContentTask]:
        # Returns tasks for Developer B's generators
        
class QualityAssurance:
    async def assess_quality(self, content: Content) -> QualityScore:
        # Validates Developer B's generated content
```

#### Developer B → Developer A Interface:
```python
# Developer B provides these interfaces  
class TextGenerator:
    async def generate_text(self, task: ContentTask) -> str:
        # Generates content per Developer A's plan
        
class ImageGenerator:
    async def generate_image(self, task: ContentTask) -> Image:
        # Creates images per Developer A's specifications
```

#### Daily Standup Questions (15 min daily):
1. **Developer A**: "Are the agent interfaces clear? Any blocking dependencies?"
2. **Developer B**: "Are the service integrations working? Any API rate limit issues?"
3. **Both**: "What needs review today? Any integration concerns?"

#### Weekly Integration Test (Fridays):
```python
async def test_content_generation_pipeline():
    # Developer A: Create workflow and plan
    state = ContentState(original_input={"text": "test content"})
    analyzed_state = await input_analyzer.execute(state)
    planned_state = await content_planner.execute(analyzed_state)
    
    # Developer B: Generate content
    generated_state = await text_generator.execute(planned_state)
    assert generated_state.text_content["blog_post"] is not None
    
    # Developer A: Quality check
    quality_state = await quality_assurance.execute(generated_state)
    assert quality_state.quality_scores["overall"] > 0.5
```

### 🌐 Phase 3: API Integration (Week 6-7)
**Completion Criteria**: Full HTTP API workflow

#### Developer A API Endpoints:
```python
# Developer A implements these endpoints
POST /api/v1/workflows          # Creates workflow using Developer B's services
GET /api/v1/workflows/{id}      # Returns status from Developer B's database
GET /api/v1/health              # Checks Developer B's service health
```

#### Developer B API Endpoints:
```python
# Developer B implements these endpoints
GET /api/v1/content/{id}        # Returns content from database
POST /api/v1/content/export     # Exports generated content packages
```

#### Integration Protocol:
1. **Developer B** sets up FastAPI application and basic routing
2. **Developer A** implements workflow endpoints using Developer B's services
3. **Developer B** implements content endpoints using generated data
4. **Both** collaborate on authentication and middleware

#### End-of-Phase Test:
```bash
# Both developers must pass this HTTP test
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/workflows" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {"text": "Create content about AI"}}'

# Should return: {"workflow_id": "uuid", "status": "initiated"}
```

### 🧪 Phase 4: Testing & QA (Week 8-9)
